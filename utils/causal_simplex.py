    -----------------------------

        The prediction procedure is modified: 
        1. Need 3 inputs: 
            cause, effect, condition

        2. According to the PCM paper, suppose X1->X_cond->X2,
            we don't know if there is direct causation between X1 and X2 only by CCM.
            Suppose cause = X1, effect = X2, condition = Xcond.
            
            To obtain: 
            "M_cause_reconst1" - the CM estimate of cause from effect;
            (first, "M_cond_reconst" - the CM estimate of M_cond from effect);
            then, "M_cause_reconst2" - the CM estimate of cause from "M_cond_reconst.

        3. Compute the partial correlation: ParCorr(X1, X1_reconst1 | X1_reconst2):
            Intuition is that now the information flow through the intermediate Xcond is eliminated,
            so if there is still a strong correlation between X1 and X1_reconst1,
            then X1 and X2 are directly causally related.
            The larger the ParCorr, the stronger the direct causation.
